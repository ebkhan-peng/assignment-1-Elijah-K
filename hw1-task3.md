Answer the following questions based on exercises from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*.

## Chapter 2.4 Exercises

### Exercise 1 (ISLP exercise 2)

Explain whether each scenario is a **classification or regression** problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in **inference or prediction**. Finally, provide **n** (size of observation dataset) and **p** (number of predictors).

**(a)**  We collect data on 200 protected marine reserves worldwide. For each reserve we record species richness, reserve size, years since establishment, enforcement budget, and proximity to human settlements. We are interested in understanding which factors affect species richness.

> This is regression because the response variable (species richness) is quantitative. n = 200. p = 3

---

**(b)** A conservation agency wants to know whether a proposed habitat corridor will successfully support wildlife movement or fail to do so. They collect data on 30 previously established corridors. For each corridor they have recorded whether wildlife movement was successful or unsuccessful, corridor width, length, surrounding land use type, and eight other variables.

> This is classification becuase the response variable (success of wildlife movement) is qualitative. n = 30. p = 10

---

**(c)** We are interested in predicting weekly average ground-level ozone concentration in a coastal city. We collect weekly data for all of 2019. For each week we record average ozone concentration, sea surface temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and atmospheric

> This is regression becuase the response variable (ozone concentration) is quantitative. n = 52. p = 4

### Exercise 2 (ISLP exercise 5)

What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a a less flexible) approach for regression? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?

> A flexible approach for regression decreases bias, but can increase variance. A more flexible approach can be preferred if there is a lot of data and low variability between samples. The flexibility will fit the data more accurately. A less flexible is preferred when there is less data and higher variation between samples.

### Exercise 3 (ISLP exercise 6)

Describe the differences between a **parametric** and a **non-parametric** statistical learning approach. What are the **advantages** of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric approach)? What are its **disadvantages**?

> A parametric approach assumes a functional form of f. It uses training data to fit models and estimate parameters. A non-parametric approach makes no assumption about the form of f. It finds the best fit to the data. A parametric approach works well with smaller data sets and is easy to interpret for making inferences. However, the assumed form of f may be far from the true f. In addition, parametric approaches struggle with predictions.
